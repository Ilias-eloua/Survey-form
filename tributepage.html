        <p>All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the worlds, and peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and companions. After that:</p>
        <p>The Quran is the Book of Allah, which He revealed to His Messenger Muhammad (peace be upon him), and it is the greatest of the divine books. It is the final book, and it encompasses all the previous books. It is the Word of Allah, as He says in the Quran: "Allah, there is no god but He, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of existence. He has sent down the Book to you, the Truth, confirming what was before it, and He has sent down the Torah and the Gospel. Before, as guidance for the people, and He has sent down the Al-Furqan (the Quran)."</p>
        <p>It is the greatest miracle of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). Allah challenged both the jinn and mankind to bring something like it: "Say: 'If mankind and the jinn gathered to bring the like of this Quran, they would never be able to bring the like of it, even if some of them were helpers of others.'" He then challenged them to bring ten chapters like it: "Or do they say that he has fabricated it? Say: 'Then bring ten chapters like it and call upon whomever you can besides Allah, if you are truthful.'" He then challenged them to even bring one surah like it: "And if you are in doubt about what We have sent down to Our servant, then bring a surah like it and call your witnesses besides Allah, if you are truthful."</p>
        <p>And they failed, despite their enmity towards the Prophet (peace be upon him), despite their desire to deny him, despite their eloquence and linguistic prowess. They failed, and they will never be able to bring even one surah like any of the chapters of the Quran. This proves that the Quran is from Allah, that it is His Word, and that it is evidence for the truth of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and his message.</p>
        <p>This is the proof of the truth of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and of the message he brought. The Quran is an infallible proof for all of humanity until the Day of Judgment. It is the enduring miracle of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), a miracle that will always remain. There are other miracles performed by the Prophet, but the Quran is the only miracle that remains and is unshakable as proof of his truthfulness.</p>
        <p>The Qur'an is the holy book of Islam, believed to be the word of God revealed to the Prophet Muhammed (peace be upon him). It is a timeless source of guidance for all aspects of life.</p>
